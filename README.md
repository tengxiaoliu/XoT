## Install dependencies

Install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt file:
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code

### Generate XoT results

Please put your api key in the Line 24 of `brain.py` file.

We here provide the command to generate XoT results on GSM8K. To run the code on other datasets, please change the `--dataset` argument accordingly.

```
bash scripts/run_gsm.sh
```

This will produce 6 files in the `outputs/gsm` folder.


### Evaluate and Analyze

We use the `analyze.py` script to evaluate and analyze the generated XoT results, which provides a thorough analysis as reported in the paper. 
To run the script, please use the following command:
```
bash scripts/eval_gsm.sh
```
You can also directly run the analysis with the above command using the output files we produced in the `outputs/gsm` folder.
